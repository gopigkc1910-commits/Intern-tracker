## Suggested Stack

- Frontend: Next.js 15, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Cache / queues: Redis
- Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging, email provider

1. Install frontend and backend dependencies.
2. Start PostgreSQL and Redis via Docker Compose.
3. Run the web app and API locally.
